## Build tools & versions used
No Tools were used for buids

## Steps to run the app
Please make sure that the latest dependencies are added to the project(latest version of kingfisher)

## What areas of the app did you focus on?
I really wanted to focus on the UI of the app and the architecture of the app. I wanted to make the app as pleasing to the eye as possible, all with a vibrant colors and a simple design. i wanted to also make sure i followed MVVM, which is why i chose combine and SwiftUI. it makes implentation of MVVM a breeze.

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?
UI design was a primary focus for me during this project. i wanted to make a directory interesting and fun to look at. i opted not to use the traditonal List becasue i wanted something different and better suited for for a robust card view.

## How long did you spend on this project?
i spent 4.5 hours on this project

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
I would have used more packages to make organization of my assets easier(swift-Gen). i also would have added packages to add more dynamic animations and loading states

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The weakest point of the projecrt would most likely be the fact that i didnt use any custom styling. everyhting here is from native apple. From the color to the iconography. if i had more time i would have added custom colors, icons, images and typography. Also the testing didnt have time to accruately make good working test. if i had time would make this more robust. 

## Did you copy any code or dependencies? Please make sure to attribute them here!
just used KingFisher as a dependencies for Image caching

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?
i used SwiftUI for this project for 2 reasons( even though i know Block doesn use it yet.) first reason being its ease of implementing MVVM. and the fact that is quick to get great UI working and itll allow me to focus on the actual networking logic. (its also the future)
